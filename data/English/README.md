## Proteno English Dataset

This dataset contains 24, 760 sentences for text normalization sampled from Sproat and Jaitly (2016). This sample is tokenized and normalized as described in the paper.  There are two Python pickled lists containing tokenized unnormalized sentences (unnorm_list.pkl) and their corresponding tokenized normalizations (norm_list.pkl). First 60% of the data was used for training Proteno and the the models were evaluated on the other 40%.
